# SudokuGame_ComputerVision
This project revolves around building a comprehensive Sudoku application that stands out from typical puzzle games by adding a feature that detects the number of fingers a user shows to his camera to fill the cells of the sudoku.

I first started by creating a class to fully generate a Sudoku Puzzle:

At this point, it was still impossible to play with it, but I had the core concept of the
project.I next created the graphic interface with Pygame, with a feature to count the
mistakes:

I then added a feature to count the number of fingers shown to the camera and enable the possibility to fill the cells counting the fingers.

Together, these images illustrate the projectâ€™s core progression and the distinctive user
interactions that set it apart from typical Sudoku applications.
